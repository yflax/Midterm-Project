Mohammed A. and Yael F. repository for collaborating on Midterm-Project

## Project/Goals
Implement targeted, data-driven measures to address different crime types when they are likely to occur in Toronto.

## Method:
Predict crime type with a classification model and find features of significance that correlate with various crime types.

## Process:
1- Download the "Major Crime Indicators" dataset from the Toronto Police Services website and join it with the "Toronto Neighbourhood Demographics' Cean Data" dataset.
2- EDA analysis, clean the dataset and try to find patterns in data between crime type/count and features by using a statistical model.
3- Build the model, create multiple classification models and compare them to determine the best.
4- Visualization, create a dashboard using Tableau to present our findings and build the story.

## Results:
-Random Forest has the best result with 61.9% accuracy.
-Decision Tree comes next with 60% accuracy.
- KNN was last with only 59% accuracy

## Challenges:
The dataset was too large, and we couldn't apply API to it due to free usage limitation

## Future Goals
Join the dataset with other open Toronto datasets and try to improve our model.
